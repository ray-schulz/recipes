title: Chicken and Broccoli Noodle Casserole
---

+ 6 oz Ronzoni Smart Taste noodles (or no-yolk)
+ 2 tsp vegetable oil
+ 4 cloves garlic, slices thin
+ 12 oz broccoli florets, chopped
+ 1 tbsp butter
+ 1 medium shallot, minced
+ 3 tbsp all purpose flour
+ 1 3/4 cups chicken broth
+ 1 cup milk
+ 12 oz cooked shredded chicken breast
+ 4 oz shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
+ 3 tbsp shredded parmesan cheese
+ 2 tbsp season bread crumbs

1. Cook noodles in salted water until al dente, or slightly undercooked by 2 minutes. Set aside.

2. Heat oil in a large skillet. Add garlic and cook on medium heat until golden, about 1 minute. Add broccoli and a little salt, saute and cover the broccoli for about 3 minutes on medium heat until the broccoli begins to soften. Set aside.

3. Preheat oven to 375F. Lightly spray a 9x12 casserole dish with cooking spray.

4. In a large pot, heat butter over medium-low heat, when melted add the shallot and cook until soft, about 2-3 minutes. Add the flour and a pinch of salt and stir well, cooking an additional 2-3 minutes on medium-low heat.

5. Slowly whick in the chicken broth until well combined over medium heat; whick well for 30 seconds, then add the milk and bring to a boil. Simmer on medium heat, mixing occasionally until it thickens (about 6-7 minutes). Remove from heat and add Cheddar and 1 tbsp of the Parmesan cheese; mix well until the cheese melts.

6. Add the shredded chicken, noodles and broccoli to the sauce and mix well until evenly coated.

7. Port into a casserole dish and top with Parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs. Spray a little more cooking spray on top and bake for about 20-25 minutes. Place the casserole under the broiler for a few minutes to get the crumbs crisp and golden (careful not to burn).
