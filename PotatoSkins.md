title: Potato Skins
---

+ 6 small to medium sized russet baking potatoes (3 lbs)
+ olive oil
+ canola oil or grape seed oil
+ salt
+ pepper
+ bacon bits
+ grated Cheddar cheese
+ sour cream
+ 2 green onions, thinly sliced

1. Scrub potatoes clean. Rub with olive oil and bake at 400F for about an hour until the potatoes are cooked through and give a little when pressed.

2. Remove potatoes, let cool enough to handle. Cut in half horizontally. Use a spoon to carefully scoop out the insides. Leave about 1/4 inch of potato on the skin.

3. Increase oven heat to 450F. Brush or rub canola oil all over potato skins, inside and out. Sprinkle with salt. Place on a baking rack in a roasting pan than can take the heat. Cook for 10 minutes, then flip and cook 10 minutes on the other side. Remove from oven and let cool enough to handle.

4. Arrange potato skins, skin side down, on the roasting pan or rack. Sprinkle insides with pepper, cheese and bacon bits. Return to oven. Broil for an additional 2 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly. Remove from oven and place on serving plate. Add a dollop of sour cream to each skin, sprinkle with green onions.
