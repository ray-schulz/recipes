title: Creole Potato Salad
---

+ 2 lbs Yukon gold or new potatoes, cut into 1 to 2 inch chunks
+ 6 hard boiled eggs, coarsely chopped
+ 1 small onion, chopped
+ 2 stalks celery, diced
+ 1 green pepper, diced
+ 2 tbsp vinegar
+ 1 tsp sugar
+ 1/2 cup Creole mustard
+ 3/4 cup mayonnaise (more or less to taste)
+ salt
+ Creole seasoning

1. Place potatoes in a large pot, cover with water by an inch. Bring to a boil and add about a tsp of salt. Lower heat to a simmer and cover. Cook until the potatoes are fork tender, about 10 minutes. Drain.

2. While boiling potatoes, mix the sugar, vinegar, mayonnaise and mustard in with the celery, peppers and onion in a large bowl.

3. While potatoes are still warm, gently mix them in with the dressing.

4. Gently fold the chopped, hard boiled eggs into the potato mixture until well combined. Add salt to taste. 

5. Garnish with Creole seasoning. Refrigerate at least an hour before serving.
