title: Beef Stew
---

+ 3 lbs boneless chuck roast, cut into 2 inch pieces
+ 3 tbsp vegetable oil
+ 2 tsp salt
+ 1 tbsp pepper
+ 2 yellow onions, cut into 1 inch chunks
+ 1/4 cup flour
+ 3 cloves garlic, minced
+ 1 can (12 oz) full flavored beer
+ 2 cups beef broth
+ 1/2 tsp dried rosemary
+ 1 bay leaf
+ 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
+ 4 carrots, peeled, cut into 1 inch slices
+ 2 stalks celery, cut into 1 inch slices
+ 3 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut into eighths

1. On medium-high heat, add vegetable oil to a large, heavy pot with a tight fitting lid.

2. When it begins to smoke slightly, add beef and brown very well. Add salt and pepper as beef browns. Remove beef and set aside.

3. Add onions and saute for about 5 minutes until softened.

4. Reduce heat to medium-low, add flour and cook for 2 minutes, stirring often.

5. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.

6. Add beer and deglaze pan, scraping any brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. The flour will start to thicken the beer as it comes to a simmer.

7. Simmer beer for 5 minutes, then add broth, bay leaf, thyme, rosemary and beef.

8. Bring to gentle simmer, cover and cook on very low for about 1 hour.

9. Add potatoes, carrots and celery, simmer covered for another 30 minutes or until meat and vegetables are tender. Adjust seasoning as desired.

10. Let sit 15 minutes before serving.
